 

Queue:
-------------


Queue  means   First in  First out  policy

queues are specifically designed to operate in a FIFO context (first-in first-out), 

where elements are inserted into one end of the container and extracted from the other.


<QUEUE><<Str>> q11 = <NEW> <QUEUE><<Str>>();
  
            
             q11.enqueue("1000");
             if (NOTq11.<?EMPTY>) //check  whether  the   queue  is  empty  or  not?

 CDollar.out.println(q11.<DEQUEUE> + " ");
       
        
        
        CDollar.out.println( q11.size());
